      <description>I am an engineer / scientist by training and a patent agent by profession. I studied Materials Science and Engineering (chemistry, physics, and engineering) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As an undergraduate I learned about many different materials, such as metals, ceramics, polymers, and semiconductors. I did my graduate work on electronic materials, like those used in integrated circuits and electronic devices. Later I got my MBA at INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France.</description>
