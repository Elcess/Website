      <description>I am an engineer / scientist by training and a patent agent by profession. I studied Materials Science and Engineering (chemistry, physics, and engineering) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As an undergraduate I learned about many different materials, such as metals, ceramics, polymers, and semiconductors. I did my graduate work on electronic materials, like those used in integrated circuits and electronic devices. Later I got my MBA at INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France.</description>

      <description>To explore the relationship between economic factors and birth rate, locate and download economic indicator and birth rate data.
Project OverviewDataData on gross domestic product and birth rate for the world, the United States of America, and five groups of countries aggregated by income was located on the World Bank Data Bank website. Data for the period 1998-2015 was downloaded in comma-separated value (CSV) format. Information on birth rate by US State was obtained from the Centers for Disease Controlb</description>

      <description>To explore the relationship between economic factors and birth rate, chart US birth rate over a time period with changing economic conditions.
Project OverviewDataPreviously gathered and tidied data on US births by State and year were read into a programming environment.
TechnologiesThe R programming language was used to read, transform, and plot data. Packages used included plyr, dplyr, data.table, and ggplot2, all from the tidyverse.
TechniquesData files in several formats were read into a programming environment.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>To explore the relationship between economic factors and birth rate, chart birth rate and economic indicators for several regions over a time period with changing economic conditions.
Project OverviewDataPreviously gathered data on birth rates and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for the period 1998â€“2015 were tidied using a spreadsheet program and then read into a programming environment.
TechnologiesSome downloaded data were reformed into a tidy data file using Microsoft Excel.</description>
