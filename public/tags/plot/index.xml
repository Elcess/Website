      <description>To explore the relationship between economic factors and birth rate, chart US birth rate over a time period with changing economic conditions.
Project OverviewDataPreviously gathered and tidied data on US births by State and year were read into a programming environment.
TechnologiesThe R programming language was used to read, transform, and plot data. Packages used included plyr, dplyr, data.table, and ggplot2, all from the tidyverse.
TechniquesData files in several formats were read into a programming environment.</description>
